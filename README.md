### Data Collection Process
The Spotify data was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts). Kaggle is a website and online community where users can share and download datasets. 

The owner of the dataset is [Dhruvil Dave](https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave). He is a graduate student from the University of Texas at Dallas and collaborated together with editor [Aneri Dalwadi](https://www.kaggle.com/aneridalwadiand). She is a student at the University of Texas at Austin. Together they shared this Spotify dataset whch includes all the "Top 200" and "Viral 50" charts published globally by Spotify. Spotify publishes a new chart every 2-3 days, and te dataset includes its entire collection since January 1, 2017 until December 31, 2021. They published the dataset on Kaggle under the license ` Database: Open Database, Contents: Â© Original Authors`

For our projects purpose, we cleaned the data to only include the United States' charts in 2021.
